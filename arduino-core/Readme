Unfortunately, some of the code we need is already in the supplied
arduino libraries in an incomplete form.   So, we need to modify it.

Two files need to be substituted into your arduino libraries:
   
    USBAPI.h
    HID.cpp

The versions in this directory are based on arduino-1.0.5.  If using
that version, rename the originals and then make symbolic links (shortcuts) to 
the files in this directory.

On Fedora linux, I did:

     sudo yum install arduino-1.0.5

     here=`/bin/pwd`

     cd /usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino
     sudo mv USBAPI.h USBAPI.h.orig
     sudo mv HID.cpp HID.cpp.orig

     ln -s $here/USBAPI.h .
     ln -s $here/HID.cpp .

     cd $here
