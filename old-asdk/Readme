For older versions of the Arduino SDK (software development kit) some
of the code we need is already in the supplied arduino libraries in an
incomplete form.  So, we need to modify it.  This code here works for
arduino-1.0.5.

Ignore this directory if using the latest arduino-1.6.6

For arduino-1.0.5, two files found in the arduino-core directory need to be
substituted into the arduino libraries:
   
    USBAPI.h
    HID.cpp

The versions in arduino-core are based on arduino-1.0.5.  If using
that version, rename the originals and then make symbolic links (shortcuts) to 
the files in this directory.

On Fedora linux, I did:

     sudo yum install arduino-1.0.5

     here=`/bin/pwd`

     cd /usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/cores/arduino
     sudo mv USBAPI.h USBAPI.h.orig
     sudo mv HID.cpp HID.cpp.orig

     ln -s $here/USBAPI.h .
     ln -s $here/HID.cpp .

     cd $here

Recent Ubuntu also packages arduino-1.0.5, so that ought to be similar.
